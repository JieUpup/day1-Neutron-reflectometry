# day1-Neutron-reflectometry

This repo is a example to do the calculate NR with day1 specualr dataset using redl1d and refnx.

The patterns is very similary for day1 data but the refnx is more accuate than refl1d when do other days, expeciallt the redl1d will found the stright line in the layer1. Also when the parameters had big changes, the refl1d is not changed too much compare with refnx.
